            <p class="teacher-bio">Sofia joined a ceramics class on a whim 4 years ago and hasn't looked
                back! After
                attending a
                few workshops, she
                decided to study for a Ceramics MA at Staffordshire university and is now a full time potter. Mugs and
                plant pots are her favourite things to make, and she loves experimenting with texture in her designs.

            <p class="text-muted"><em>Teacher</em></p>
            <p>Stella was introduced to ceramics on a team-building event at work and decided to keep up the practice
                after reaping the therapeutic benefits of clay! She produces work at the studio part-time and wants to
                pass her passion onto others at Social Ceramics! Experimenting with shape and movement, Stella loves
                creating decorative, abstract pieces.

            <p class="text-muted"><em>Teacher</em></p>
            <p>Nora discovered her love of ceramics in college where she studied Art & Design. Finding the ceramics
                module to be
                too short, she pursued it as a hobby by taking classes with a friend in her spare time. Nora has
                explored the world, finding inspiration and collecting ceramics from her travels. Nora creates amazing,
                intricate pieces, and you'll find her experimenting with glazes and slip designs.
